# Employee Attrition Analysis Project

In this Excel project, I conducted a detailed analysis of employee attrition within the company. The primary goal was to gain insights into the factors influencing employee turnover and to present the findings in a clear and visually appealing manner.

## Project Overview

- **Data Cleaning**: I meticulously cleaned the data, ensuring its accuracy and reliability for a robust analysis.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Utilizing Excel's powerful features such as pivot tables, pivot charts, and various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), I examined the impact of factors such as gender, education level, job role, department, age, and marital status on attrition.

- **Attrition Percentages**: In addition to providing an overall view of attrition in terms of absolute numbers, I calculated attrition percentages to provide a more comprehensive understanding.

- **Employee Satisfaction Ratio**: To gauge employee satisfaction, I introduced a satisfaction ratio derived from job satisfaction levels, contributing to a more nuanced analysis.

## Visual Representation

The tools and functionalities in Excel enabled me to present the findings in a visually compelling manner. I utilized charts and graphs to illustrate the patterns and insights derived from the data, making it easier for stakeholders to grasp the key takeaways.

## Conclusion

This project not only shed light on the factors influencing attrition within the company but also highlighted the power of Excel in conducting in-depth workforce analyses.
